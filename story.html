  <h1>COVID-19 Might Help Slow Tobacco Use Among Kids</h1>
  <h4>By Spencer Dobkin</h4>
  <h5>*Teenagers' last names were witheld for anonymity*</h5>
  <p>Before the madness of COVID-19 and the Australian wildfires, we had e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury. EVALI — a term that most of us probably haven’t heard — was easily one of the biggest problems this country was facing.</p>
  <p>While EVALI is a general acronym for any vape-related lung injury recognized by the CDC since around August 2019, it affects very specific groups: 15% of patients were under 18, and 37% were 18 to 24 years old.</p>    <p>There have been 2,807 hospitalized cases or deaths in the U.S. as of Feb. 18, according to the <a href="">CDC</a>. They have since identified vitamin E acetate as the problematic substance in e-cigarettes, and many manufacturers removed it from their products.</p>

  <h3>Nicotine Is Addicting</h3>
  <p>More problems lie ahead for the 15 to 24 year olds who won’t be able to quit before their addictions get worse. With cases of EVALI heavily decreasing in late 2019, young people had no scary reason to stop their nicotine usage. There is now a rising population of tobacco users and young adults addicted to nicotine.</p>
  <p>“I truly haven’t seen enough to make me want to quit,” said Carson, a 17-year-old from Florida who prefers to stay anonymous. He added that he has to keep going back because “...there’s nicotine...it’s addictive,” Carson said.</p>
  <p>In a response to there being over 5 million e-cigarette users among middle and high school students, the federal government raised the minimum age of sale of tobacco products from 18 to 21 years old. Soon after many e-cigarette flavors were banned, specifically those that appeal to teens, like mint and fruit, and only applied to specific devices.</p>

  <p>17-year-old Gavin, from Boca Raton, Fla, said he used e-cigarettes to find “the buzz.” When asked about showing proof of age Gavin said, “Some places do [ask for ID], some don’t. I’ve never had trouble getting one.” Years away from being able to legally purchase tobacco products, Gavin says it’s all about knowing what stores will sell to you, and which will not.</p>
  <p>Without long-term data and research on all chemicals in e-cigarettes, we don’t yet know how vaping affects health after extended periods of time, but we can use what we know from traditional tobacco products.</p>
  <p>Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart disease, says there are likely <a href="">fewer chemicals in vaping products than the 7,000 in cigarettes</a>, the primary one being nicotine. The addictive chemical creates the urge to smoke and withdrawal if you don’t, along with a higher blood pressure and adrenaline, both known to increase heart rate and the chance of having a heart attack.</p>
  <h3>Financial Burden</h3>
  <p>Smoking tobacco products can also do damage to wallets over a lifetime. New Yorkers spend $3,822 a year out-of-pocket on smoking, the most of any state, according to <a href="">Wallethub</a>. That isn’t including each person’s share of the more than $300 billion a year that smoking costs the United States from medical care and lost productivity.</p>

  <p>Jefferies Financial Group analysts called tobacco “recession proof” in an <a href="">article for Business Insider</a>, touting smokers’ carelessness toward the risks associated with tobacco, such as cancer, during the COVID-19 outbreak. They did find that new nicotine users might be less likely to start vaping in fear of health risks, being more conscious of what they’re putting in their bodies during this time.</p>
  <p>While states that have closed all non-essential businesses, many vape shops have been forced to stop operating amid concerns of spreading COVID-19, leaving cigarettes as the main tobacco product available at this time. That, along with cigarettes accounting for only 5.8% of tobacco use among high schoolers, could severely change the landscape of younger people and vaping.</p>

</script>
  <p>Will this be the final hit to e-cigarettes? We can’t tell just yet, something we can say for nearly everything going on in today’s world, but young people will definitely be vaping less while the country is focused on stopping the COVID-19 spread.</p>
